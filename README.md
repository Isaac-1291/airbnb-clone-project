Team Roles and Responsibilities

- Project Manager: Oversees the entire development lifecycle, ensures milestones are met, and facilitates communication across the team.
- Frontend Developer: Implements UI components and ensures responsive, accessible interfaces using React.
- Backend Developer: Handles server-side logic, builds RESTful and GraphQL APIs, and integrates third-party services.
- Database Administrator (DBA): Designs and manages the relational database schema, optimizes queries, and ensures data integrity.
- DevOps Engineer: Sets up CI/CD pipelines, configures containers, and manages deployment workflows.
- QA Engineer: Writes test cases, performs bug tracking, and ensures quality assurance.

Backend Technology Stack

- Django: Backend web framework used for building the application logic and APIs.
- MySQL: Relational database system to manage and store structured application data.
- GraphQL: API query language that allows clients to request only the data they need.
- Docker: Containerization platform for packaging and deploying the application in isolated environments.
- GitHub Actions: Automation tool for CI/CD workflows, enabling continuous integration and deployment.
- React: JavaScript library for building the frontend user interface.

Backend Database Design Overview

Key Entities and Fields

1. Users
   - id
   - username
   - email
   - password
   - is_host (boolean)

2. Properties
   - id
   - title
   - description
   - price_per_night
   - owner_id (FK to Users)

3. Bookings
   - id
   - user_id (FK to Users)
   - property_id (FK to Properties)
   - start_date
   - end_date

4. Reviews
   - id
   - user_id (FK to Users)
   - property_id (FK to Properties)
   - rating
   - comment

5. Payments
   - id
   - booking_id (FK to Bookings)
   - amount
   - payment_status
   - payment_method

Relationships
- A user can own multiple properties
- A booking links a user and a property
- Reviews are written by users for properties
- Payments are associated with bookings

Backend Feature Breakdown


- User Management: Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles. Hosts can list properties while guests can book them.

- Property Management: Hosts can add, update, or remove property listings including photos, descriptions, and availability.

- Booking System: Guests can book properties for specific dates, with availability checks and total price calculations.

- Review System: After a stay, users can leave a review and rate the property and host.

- Payment Integration: A secure payment gateway handles transactions for bookings, storing payment status and methods.

- Search & Filter: Users can browse listings using filters like location, price, amenities, and availability.

- Admin Panel: Admins can manage users, properties, bookings, and reports for maintenance and support.


Backend API Security

- Authentication: Only registered users can access protected endpoints using token-based or session-based authentication.

- Authorization: Role-based access control to prevent unauthorized data access (e.g., only property owners can update their listings).

- Rate Limiting: Protects against DDoS and brute-force attacks by limiting the number of requests per time frame.

- Input Validation: Prevents injection attacks by sanitizing user inputs on both frontend and backend.

- Data Encryption: Sensitive user data like passwords are encrypted using hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt).

Importance
- Ensures user data protection and privacy.
- Maintains transaction security for payments.
- Prevents unauthorized access to critical resources.

Backend CI/CD Pipeline

What is CI/CD?
CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) automates the integration and deployment of code, allowing for faster, more reliable software delivery.

Tools and Workflow
- GitHub Actions: Automates testing and deployment pipelines on every commit or pull request.
- Docker: Ensures environment consistency from development to production by containerizing the app.
- Testing Tools: Unit and integration tests are executed during the CI phase to catch bugs early.

Benefits
- Minimizes deployment errors and manual work.
- Speeds up the delivery process.
- Maintains high code quality and system reliability.
